	~ Modified documentation link: It now reports if documentation is not available at all or if it still has to be rendered.
	# Fixed a very nasty bug in the functions which render the documentation links: Because $TSFE->cObj->getTypoLink() was used, no cHashes were created which resulted in display of the list of extension manuals instead of a specific manual
	# Links to download versions of documentation now come with a "no_cache=1"

05.03.2006 Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	~ Output format classes must now extend either tx_terdoc_documentformat_display or tx_terdoc_documentformat_download
