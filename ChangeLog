	* changed category assignment (fetching method). This was the main problem on typo3.org and prevented render of documentation links
	
Version 2.0.3 2006-12-16	Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	+ You can now link to the most recent version of a manual (or enter the url directly) without having to add the "current" parameter: http://typo3.org/documentation/document-library/extension-manuals/tt_news/

Version 2.0.2 2006-12-15	Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>
	+ A little improvement: The plugin can now distinguish between "not yet rendered" and "not available but I don't have an error report either".

Version 2.0.1 2006-12-15	Robert Lemke <robert@typo3.org>

	~ Modified documentation link: It now reports if documentation is not available at all or if it still has to be rendered.
	# Fixed a very nasty bug in the functions which render the documentation links: Because $TSFE->cObj->getTypoLink() was used, no cHashes were created which resulted in display of the list of extension manuals instead of a specific manual
	# Links to download versions of documentation now come with a "no_cache=1"
