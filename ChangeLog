	~ Modified documentation link: It now reports if documentation is not available at all or if it still has to be rendered.
	# Fixed a very nasty bug in the functions which render the documentation links: Because $TSFE->cObj->getTypoLink() was used, no cHashes were created which resulted in display of the list of extension manuals instead of a specific manual
	# Links to download versions of documentation now come with a "no_cache=1"
